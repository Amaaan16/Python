# Python

In this comprehensive data analysis project centered around the Indian Premier League(IPL), I harnessed the power of Python libraries such as Pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to delve into a wealth of data spanning IPL matches from 2008 to 2017. With the overarching aim of shedding light on various dimension of IPL games, I meticulously applied data cleaning techniques to ensure the integrity and relevance of the dataset. My analysis encompassed both player-level information, including batting and bowling statistics and match-level deatils such as venues, winners and scores.
